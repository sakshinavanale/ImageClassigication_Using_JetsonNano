# 🤖 Real-Time Image Classification on Jetson Nano

This project implements a real-time image classification system using a USB camera and a fine-tuned **ResNet-18** model, deployed on the **NVIDIA Jetson Nano**.
This project was developed as part of my **Final Year Internship** at **Ioscape**, in collaboration with the **NVIDIA Deep Learning Institute (DLI)** course on **AI Fundamentals using Jetson Nano**

## 🎯 Project Summary

- ✅ Live camera input via `jetcam`
- ✅ Classification using a fine-tuned ResNet-18 model
- ✅ Real-time inference directly on the Jetson Nano (edge device)
- ✅ Custom image categories: `thumbs_up`, `thumbs_down`
- ✅ PyTorch-based model training and inference pipeline

## 🧠 Learning Objectives

Through this project, I learned how to:

- Set up and use the NVIDIA Jetson Nano with a USB camera
- Train and deploy custom image classification models using PyTorch
- Use pre-trained CNNs (ResNet-18) for transfer learning
- Capture and preprocess live camera input for inference
- Run real-time deep learning inference at the edge
